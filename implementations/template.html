      <h1>Introduction</h1>

      <p>
The purpose of this document is to demonstrate that there are at least two
interoperable implementations of processors that are capable of generating
output that is conformant to the Verifiable Credentials Data Model.
      </p>

      <section class="informative">
        <h2>Testing Methodology</h2>

        <p>
The testing framework for the Verifiable Credentials Data Model executes the
following process for every conformance statement in the Verifiable Credentials
Data Model:
        </p>

        <ol class="algorithm">
          <li>
Take an input file template that exercises the feature and feed it to a
developer provided Verifiable Credentials Data Model generator.
          </li>
          <li>
If the input is valid, generate a Verifiable Credential that is conformant
to the data model.
          </li>
          <li>
The test suite then ensures that the generated Verifiable Credential is
conformant to the feature being tested.
          </li>
        </ol>

      <h1>Conformance Testing Results</h1>

      <h3>Key</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>✓ - Success</li>
        <li>❌ - Error</li>
        <li>no support - Implementation explicitly does not support this feature</li>
        <li>untested - This test is new, implementation has not been run on it yet</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
The results of the conformance testing are shown below:
